            I'm an Java Developer with over 1 year of experience in building scalable web applications. 
            My expertise lies in Java, Spring Framework, and React.js, allowing me to create robust backend systems 
            and intuitive user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            I'm passionate about clean code, efficient algorithms, and creating software that solves real-world problems. 
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
            or sharing my knowledge through tech blogs.
